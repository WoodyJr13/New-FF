    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>FutureFix is a student-led nonprofit that empowers middle and high school students to solve real-world problems through creative thinking, teamwork, and hands-on design. Using accessible materials—like wood, cardboard, and simple tools—students bring their ideas to life by building functional prototypes that address real-world challenges.</p>
    <p>But FutureFix goes beyond just building. Participants also learn how to pitch their ideas to a panel of judges or simulated "investors," strengthening their confidence, communication, and entrepreneurial thinking. Events are competitive, with teams earning prizes based on creativity, functionality, and presentation—preparing the next generation of builders and leaders.</p>
